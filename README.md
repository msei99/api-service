**API Service**

I will manage a PassivBot instance for you, using either my existing configurations or your custom setup. You need to create a SubAccount and generate an API with futures trading permissions. The minimum investment is 1,000 USDT. The setup fee is $20, and there's a monthly fee of 10% of profits. If no profit is made in a month, the following monthâ€™s operation is free. Please note that all invested capital is at risk, and I assume no liability for losses. Contact me for more information.
